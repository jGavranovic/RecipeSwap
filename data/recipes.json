Prepare the filling: If using ground meat, mix it with your choice of seasonings (such as garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and green onions). If using vegetables, chop them finely and saut√© with seasonings until tender. Let the filling cool completely.\r\n\r\n2.    Make the dough: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water while stirring until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.\r\n\r\n3.    Roll out the dough: After resting, divide the dough into small pieces and roll each piece into a thin circle (about 3 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin.\r\n\r\n4.    Fill the dumplings: Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Be careful not to overfill.\r\n\r\n    Fold and seal the dumplings: Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges together to seal the dumplings. You can also pleat the edges for a decorative touch.\r\n\r\n    Cook the dumplings: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the dumplings to the boiling water and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface and are cooked through.\r\n\r\n    Serve: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and serve hot with soy sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil for dipping, if desired.","imageName":"2.jpeg","user":"mitch","id":2},{"title":"Tacos de Carnitas","prepTime":"60","tags[]":["gluten-free","nut-free","dairy-free","mexican","lunch","dinner"],"ingredients":"2 lbs pork shoulder, cut into chunks\r\n1 onion, quartered\r\n4 cloves garlic, smashed\r\n2 bay leaves\r\n1 tablespoon dried oregano\r\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\r\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\r\n1 teaspoon chili powder\r\nSalt and pepper to taste\r\n2 cups chicken or pork broth\r\n1 orange, juiced\r\nCorn tortillas\r\nChopped onion\r\nChopped cilantro\r\nSalsa (your favorite kind)\r\nLime wedges\r\nOptional: sliced radishes, avocado slices, shredded lettuce, crumbled queso fresco","steps":"Instructions:\r\n\r\n1.
